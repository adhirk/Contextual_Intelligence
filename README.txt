Topic: 

Navigating the Future: Contextual Ad Targeting as the New Frontier in Privacy-Compliant Advertising


The Problem area: 

How can we use machine learning to help advertisers reach their target audiences in the digital marketing world post cookie depreciation? Google and other major digital tech companies are going through a transition in finding better ways to help brands connect with their potential customers in a privacy centric way.


The User: 

Advertisers, Publishers, and Customers will be impacted when cookies and mobile IDs go away. Customers will see ads that are totally irrelevant, Advertisers would experience low ROI when there is no efficient targeting methods and finally Publishers will start losing dollars since they can’t connect advertisers and users effectively.


The Big Idea:  

What if there is a way to understand/classify the content that the user is interacting? This signal can then be capitalized to serve ads effectively, especially in a world where there is no personal identifiers (cookies, Mobile IDs). Example: A user browsing through articles on travel is most likely going to make that trip and it would only make sense to show ads relevant travel ads next to those articles. 


The Impact: 

Cookie depreciation or lack of user tracking tools can have huge impact at the industry level with losses projected up to $10 billion.
“..the Interactive Advertising Bureau estimates publishers' exposure at up to $10 billion in lost revenue without third-party cookies..” 


Dataset:

For this project, I have selected "News Category Dataset" dataset from Kaggle which contains around 210k news headlines from 2012 to 2022 published in HuffPost. This is one of the biggest news datasets and can serve as a benchmark for a variety of computational linguistic tasks. HuffPost stopped maintaining an extensive archive of news articles sometime after this dataset was first collected in 2018, so it is not possible to collect such a dataset in the present day. Due to changes in the website, there are about 200k headlines between 2012 and May 2018 and 10k headlines between May 2018 and 2022.


Data Dictionary:

`category`: category in which the article was published. 
`headline`: the headline of the news article.
`authors`: list of authors who contributed to the article.
`link`: link to the original news article.
`short_description`: Abstract of the news article.
`date`: publication date of the article.
