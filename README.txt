Topic: 

Navigating the Future: Contextual Ad Targeting as the New Frontier in Privacy-Compliant Advertising


The Problem area: 

How can we use machine learning to help advertisers reach their target audiences in the digital marketing world post cookie depreciation? Google and other major digital tech companies are going through a transition in finding better ways to help brands connect with their potential customers in a privacy centric way.


The User: 

Advertisers, Publishers, and Customers will be impacted when cookies and mobile IDs go away. Customers will see ads that are totally irrelevant, Advertisers would experience low ROI when there is no efficient targeting methods and finally Publishers will start losing dollars since they can’t connect advertisers and users effectively.


The Big Idea:  

What if there is a way to understand/classify the content that the user is interacting? This signal can then be capitalized to serve ads effectively, especially in a world where there is no personal identifiers (cookies, Mobile IDs). Example: A user browsing through articles on travel is most likely going to make that trip and it would only make sense to show ads relevant travel ads next to those articles. Iceland Air Ad is displayed next to travel article.


The Impact: 

Cookie depreciation or lack of user tracking tools can have huge impact at the industry level with losses projected up to $10 billion.
“..the Interactive Advertising Bureau estimates publishers' exposure at up to $10 billion in lost revenue without third-party cookies..”
